# My Dream

Once upon a time, I had a vision of 2 very different players, playing very different games...

YET! They were able to share items, laughing and enjoying interaction in their very different experience.

<details><summary>Can you picture that?</summary>

If not, you can imagine a grandmother üëµ winning candies üç¨ in her favorite match3 game,
sending sweat powerups to her grandchild playing his favorite action game üî´.

Very different games, but very real impact! üòò "Thanks Grandma!"

</details>

# Prologue

To showcase my Grand Dream‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, I've got to build a demo!

I could make a simple local demo, sharing items offline, stored on the disk.

I could.

No.

I go big.

## Multiplayer

<details><summary>So first things first, I install <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org>Rust</a>.</summary>
<img src="./too-easy.jpg" alt="a guy smiling, a text writing 'too easy'." />
</details>

<details><summary>Then I make <a href="https://github.com/Vrixyz/backpack">server</a>.</summary>
<img src="./draw-the-rest-of-the-fucking-owl.jpg" alt="meme: draw circles, then draw an owl." />
</details>

## Demo

<details><summary>So first things first, I make a <a href="https://github.com/Vrixyz/backpack/tree/main/crates/example_game_lazy">small game</a>.</summary>
<img src="./too-easy.jpg" alt="a guy smiling, a text writing 'too easy'." />
</details>
<details><summary>Then I make a <a href="https://github.com/Vrixyz/backpack/tree/main/crates/client">client library</a> to connect to my server.</summary>
<img src="./coyote-run.jpg" alt="a cartoon coyote, preparing to run." />
</details>
<details><summary>Then I plug things together.</summary>

# Surprise!

So my plan was:
- Input a mail
- Input a password
- Create an account or connect to it
- Enjoy the API and relax.

Ah well, I have to tell you about my keyboard, I have an AZERTY one. To input `@`, I have to use <kbd>Alt-gr</kbd>.

I use bevy_egui for testing purposes (and there is no input on bevy_ui heh!)

But when I try to input `@` with my keyboard, nothing appears!

That's a problem, because every email address have an `@`...

## What's the root problem?

[To keep it short](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/149), the problem is that winit handles <kbd>Alt-gr</kbd> by sending `ctrl` + `alt`,
bevy_egui was ignoring all keys if ctrl was held. It makes sense, since ctrl is used as a "command" key on windows.

üéâ So [I fixed that](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/149), First PR in this story! üéâ

## Again.

I want to support web, but I realized my fix wasn't working on web...

[I tried to fix it again](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/181) on bevy_egui, but the handling of meta key in OSX
was proving difficult to provide an exact solution.

## Adapt, overcome!

OK, I spent quite some time on that issue now, I'm taking a break, keep a note somewhere and call it **The Altgr Problem**.

# The **copy-paste problem**

By the way, my authentication process involves a password sent to the user so he can copy it in the password field.

On wasm, bevy_egui doesn't support copying from external source, the copy is only stored from and to local (process) memory.
That's not useful to me!

## What's the root problem?

[I tracked down the problem](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/178) to the [ar board crate](https://github.com/1Password/arboard), which is [not interested in supporting web](https://github.com/1Password/arboard/issues/99) because their API is fully synchronous, fair enough, let's fix it on [bevy_egui's side!](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/178)[^3]

[^3]: There's probably room for a cross-platform copy paste crate, don't you think?

### Down the rabbit hole

Using [web-sys crate](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/) and a few [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ClipboardEvent), I had most of the implementation ready.

Most.

On web MacOS, bevy_egui currently handles copy-paste with ctrl-[XCV] ; it's wrong, because it should be Meta-[XCV], But at least it's working.

Now, reacting to clipboard web events fixes the inconsistency, GREAT right? I wish!

I discovered yet another problem [within winit](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/178#issuecomment-1571038329):
Meta key not correcty forwarded from winit.

# Winit

Thankfully, winit's folks have already detected all the shortcomings I found throughout this blog post, and a [big keyboard input refactoring](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2662) was almost ready.

At this point, I have 3 issues related to winit, most likely fixed with winit 0.29, let's try to update!

I asked around on bevy discord if anyone was working on it before rolling up my sleeves!

> "Not a fun update"

_Fran√ßois Mockers_

I've been warned.

## The tip of the iceberg.

The first task to upgrade our winit' API usage was to rename most of the Key enums.
As bevy provides a abstraction over winit for modularity's sake, that meant a few regex search and replace.

<details><summary>With good tooling the task wasn't too tedious.</summary>

<img src="./replace.png" alt="vscode replacing 47 lines with a regex replace" />

</details>

## Thanks for the help

Thanks to bevy maintainers and other contributors, I could ask my way through:
- `Copy` trait issues
- foreign types to implement bevy_reflect on top of ([SmolStr](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8771) üéâ)
- getting a confidence boost when I was in doubt ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [minor fmt fixes](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10264)

## I have to tell you about...

_I could start a farm with all those rabbit holes I followed..._

## instant crate

winit [replaced instant by web_time](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2836),
I checked on the dependencies also using instant, updated what I could, and made a note on what I could not.
`cargo tree -i` [again](http://thierryberger.com/drafts/bevy-ios-ads/#naive-implementation) my best ally.

## AccessKit

Of course AccessKit doesn't support winit 0.29, it's not released yet (when I started).

So I [started a PR](https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit/pull/256), just enough to unblock my compilation,
but sharing my work so it's helpful to others.

When winit released, the interest seemed high, and [maintainers stepped in üéâ](https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit/pull/256#issuecomment-1779944498).

## What if we could choose not to upgrade all ecosystem?

What if ecosystem crates could support every older versions of more foundation-y crates?

We could upgrade to the latest ecosystem, but still have a few outdated ones!

Right?

Well dependencies are hard, we could leverage [rustc conditional compilation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html) through [cargo features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) to support all edge cases...

I see you shouting "UNMAINTAINABLE!".

Well.

winit folks [did go the "hard way"](https://github.com/rust-mobile/ndk/pull/434): they have features for `raw-window-handle` version 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 (a.k.a `rwh_04`, `rwh_05`, `rwh_06`).

it's cool, because I don't have to wait on wgpu to update to latest `rwh_06`!

So I chose to rely on `rwh_05`.

That said, I ran a quick `cargo tree -i` to see if my dependency tree war coherent...
and `rwh_06` was still pulled in.

winit and ndk had [their default](https://github.com/rust-mobile/ndk/pull/434#issuecomment-1752089087) on `rwh_06`. I had disabled default features for those, but `android-activity` did not, so [we worked on a fix](https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity/pull/142) üéâ.

## "AAAAAA"

Everything is compiling at this point! What were we trying to achieve ?

I forgot, something related to keyboard input... Let's try the keyboard example.

It's working!

let's try to break it:
- Press shift
- press 'A'
- release shift
- release 'a'

Congratulations, I broke bevy_input. bevy_input thinks 'A' is still pressed: "Of course, you released 'a', a totally different letter!", the program told me.

<details><summary>We can't have a reliable cache on characters
if we can't have reliable events on those.</summary>

And that might be an issue on resume/suspend, but that's another story.
</details>

<br />

My PR is already quite big, and fixing that might involve a few experimentation and controversial changes,
So I chose to break it out, [check it out!](https://github.com/Vrixyz/bevy/pull/3).

I went for my guts, and implemented a "dynamic cache", relying on the underlying keycode,
but keeping in memory the current logical key.

## Better API (maybe, maybe not)

Within bevy_input, we expose 2 api to interrogate which input is on which state:
- `Input<Key>`
- `Input<KeyCode>`

I took the opportunity to change it to a more unified
- `Input<KeyLogic>` where `KeyLogic` is either a keycode (or scan code) or a logicalKey (key displayed on user's keyboard).

To this date, I'm still not 100% sure about that, if you're up to the challenge, [please review üôè](https://github.com/Vrixyz/bevy/pull/3).

## A sizeable problem

That's a pun on resizable windows, yeah.

bevy (<= 0.12) had difficulties redrawing smoothly when resizing, [I made the problem worse!](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8745#discussion_r1387034412)

TODO: Maybe This chapter will continue...

## Window out, window in

Winit now supports launching a window again through run_ondemand, [bevy still has to accomodate these changes](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8745#discussion_r1387056104).

TODO: Maybe This chapter will continue...

## Licensing

Hey, open source is hard work! Licensing exists and protects everybody from users to maintainers.

I encountered 2 licenses withing rust-windowing wihch bevy doesn't honour: keycodes and cursor icons.

TODO: Maybe This chapter will continue...


## Still ongoing

I took a few controversial decisions throughout my upgrade, and that's a risk that my PR will be delayed/reworked.

I'll update this blog post until this winit PR gets merged.

[Check my PR out!](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8745)

I wrote about all that not to show how software can be broken, but how it can be fixed! Let's fix it together!
