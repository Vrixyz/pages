# My Dream

Once upon a time, I had a vision of 2 very different players, playing very different games...

YET! They were able to share items, laughing and enjoying interaction in their very different experience.

<details><summary>Can you picture that?</summary>

If not, you can imagine a grandmother winning candies in her favorite match3 game,
sending sweat powerups to her grandchild playing his favorite action game.

Very different games, but very real impact! "Thanks Grandma!"

# Prologue

To showcase my Grand Dream‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, I've got to build a demo!

I could make a simple local demo, sharing items offline, stored on the disk.

I could.

No.

I go big.

## Multiplayer

<details><summary>So first things first, I install <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org>Rust</a>.</summary>
<img src="./too-easy.jpg" alt="a guy smiling, a text writing 'too easy'." />
</details>

<details><summary>Then I make a server.</summary>
<img src="./draw-the-rest-of-the-fucking-owl.jpg" alt="meme: draw circles, then draw an owl." />
</details>

## Demo

<details><summary>So first things first, I make a small game.</summary>
<img src="./too-easy.jpg" alt="a guy smiling, a text writing 'too easy'." />
</details>
<details><summary>Then I make a client library to connect to my server.</summary>
<img src="./coyote-run.jpg" alt="a cartoon coyote, preparing to run." />
</details>
<details><summary>Then I plug things together.</summary>

# Surprise!

So my plan was:
- Input a mail/password
- Create an account or connect to it
- Enjoy the API and relax.

Ah well, I have to tell you about my keyboard, I have an AZERTY one. To input `@`, I have to use <kbd>Alt-gr</kbd>.

I use bevy_egui for testing purposes (and there is no input on bevy_ui heh!)

But when I try to input `@` with my keyboard, nothing appears!

That's a problem.

## What's the root problem?

[To keep it short](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/149), the problem is that winit handles altgr by sending `ctrl` + `alt`,
bevy_egui was ignoring all keys if ctrl was held. It makes sense, since ctrl is used as a "command" key on windows.

üéâ So I fixed that, First PR in this story! üéâ

## Again.

I want to support web, but I realized my fix wasn't working on web...
